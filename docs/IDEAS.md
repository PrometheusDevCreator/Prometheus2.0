## How to Use This File

**Founder:**
- Capture ideas here during conversations - just say "add this to IDEAS"
- Review periodically to decide what moves to TODO
- Ideas can be rough - refinement happens when promoting to TODO

**AI Assistants:**
- When Founder mentions an idea or future possibility, ask: "Shall I add this to IDEAS.md?"
- Record the date and brief description
- Do NOT implement items from this file without explicit instruction
