PROMETHEUS 2.0 – TESTING DOCTRINE
================================

Author: Matthew (Founder)
Controller: Sarah
Applies To: All Prometheus Repositories
Date: 30 December 2025

--------------------------------
1. PURPOSE
--------------------------------

This document defines the mandatory testing doctrine for the Prometheus 2.0 system.

Testing exists to:
- Preserve system integrity
- Prevent architectural drift
- Detect regressions early
- Validate operational readiness
- Enforce disciplined engineering standards

Testing is not optional.
Testing scales with system maturity.

--------------------------------
2. TEST CATEGORIES
--------------------------------

Prometheus testing operates at three graduated levels:

A. Minor Tests (MTs)
B. Implementation Tests (ITs)
C. System Operator Checks (SOCs)

--------------------------------
3. MINOR TESTS (MTs)
--------------------------------

Purpose:
Immediate sanity checks during development.

Who:
Claude Code (CC)

When:
Continuously during implementation.

Scope:
Component-level or local logic.

Examples:
- Component renders without runtime errors
- Buttons trigger expected handlers
- State updates propagate correctly
- No console warnings or errors
- Basic interaction sanity checks

Pass Criteria:
Works as expected in isolation.

--------------------------------
4. IMPLEMENTATION TESTS (ITs)
--------------------------------

Purpose:
Verify that a complete feature or subsystem works as designed.

Who:
Claude Code (CC)

When:
At the completion of each Task Order or Phase.

Scope:
Page-level or subsystem-level.

Examples:
- Create, rename, duplicate, delete Template Profiles
- Switch profiles without state leakage
- Upload templates and verify status transitions
- Mapping persistence across navigation
- Cross-context stability (FORMAT <-> DESIGN <-> BUILD)
- IndexedDB persistence across reloads

Pass Criteria:
Feature behaves correctly under normal operator use.

--------------------------------
5. SYSTEM OPERATOR CHECKS (SOCs)
--------------------------------

Purpose:
Deliberate, exhaustive verification of system readiness.

Who:
Claude Code (CC), when directed by the Founder.

When:
- Prior to major merges
- Prior to demos
- Prior to releases
- Whenever explicitly ordered by the Founder

Scope:
Entire system. No exemptions.

--------------------------------
6. FULL SOC CONTENT
--------------------------------

A Full SOC includes, but is not limited to:

UI & INTERACTION
- Every button, toggle, and dropdown exercised
- Invalid sequences attempted deliberately
- Rapid interaction stress tests

STATE & LOGIC
- Cross-page navigation stress testing
- Profile switching during partial configurations
- Clear / delete / reset sequences
- Persistence validation (IndexedDB)

DATA INTEGRITY
- No silent data loss
- No phantom or orphaned state
- No cross-profile contamination

BEHAVIOUR UNDER MISUSE
- Rapid clicking
- Incomplete configurations
- Repeated load/unload cycles
- Context switching mid-operation

--------------------------------
7. SOC REPORTING
--------------------------------

Each SOC produces a short SOC Report containing:
- Scope of checks performed
- Failures detected
- Fixes applied
- Known remaining issues

--------------------------------
8. AUTHORITY
--------------------------------

SOCs are a Founder-controlled mechanism.

They are:
- Not routine
- Not polite
- Not optional when invoked

--------------------------------
9. COMPLIANCE
--------------------------------

All contributors must:
- Understand this doctrine
- Reference it when implementing features
- Acknowledge it in repository documentation

Failure to adhere to this doctrine is a defect.
