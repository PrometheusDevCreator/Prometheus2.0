## Verb Selection Guidelines

### DO Use
- Specific, measurable action verbs
- Verbs appropriate to cognitive level
- Observable behaviours

### DON'T Use
| Ambiguous Verb | Better Alternative |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Know | Define, State, Recall |
| Understand | Explain, Describe, Summarise |
| Appreciate | Evaluate, Assess, Appraise |
| Be aware of | Identify, Recognise, List |
| Learn | Demonstrate, Apply, Execute |
| Become familiar with | Describe, Explain, Use |

## Assessment Alignment

| Cognitive Level | Suitable Assessment Methods |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| Remember | Multiple choice, True/False, Matching |

## Hierarchy Rules

1. Lower levels support higher levels
2. Students must master lower levels before higher
3. Not all objectives need to reach Level 6
4. Assessment must match the stated level
5. Verbs can appear at multiple levels (context determines level)
