# Prometheus

Prometheus is a hierarchical, AI-assisted courseware and knowledge engine ecosystem.

It is built around:

- **Matthew** — Founder, mission owner, final authority.
- **Sarah** — Controller, architect, strategist, reviewer, and long-term memory.
- **Claude Code** — Primary engineer for large-scale repo changes and new features.
- **Codex/Cursor** — Local fixer for small edits, quick refactors, and in-editor changes.
- **PKE** — Promethean Knowledge Engine; structured memory and retrieval layer.
- **Prometheus Orchestrator** — The multi-agent control tower.

This repo is a monorepo containing:

- **core/** — PKE, generation engine and API.
- **prometheus-ui/** — React frontend (primary UI application).
- **ui/** — Design assets, mockups, and prototypes.
- **orchestrator/** — Multi-agent orchestration logic.
- **docs/** — Architecture, governance, memory, and workflows.

## Testing Doctrine

Prometheus enforces a three-tier testing model:

| Level | Name | Scope | When |
|-------|------|-------|------|
| MT | Minor Tests | Component-level sanity | Continuously during development |
| IT | Implementation Tests | Feature/subsystem validation | At completion of Task Orders |
| SOC | System Operator Checks | Full system verification | Prior to releases, demos, merges (Founder-directed) |

**Testing is not optional. Testing scales with system maturity.**
